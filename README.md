# Dice Test

## NOTE
***Do this task the best you can. The best code, best graphics, it's better to spend 1 more day polishing the code and visuals than rush it and "be first" to finish the task.***

## Instructions
Create tool that rolls dice and shows random result each time. Rolling animation not needed.

Tool should have 2 options
- dots dice
- custom dice

see more in `examples` folder

### Dots dice 
Use assets located in `src/assets` folder.
### Custom dice
Use blank dice image and display custom text on dice face.  
You should be able to specify this text for each of 6 faces of custom dice.

## Code
You can use plain JavaScript/TypeScript or with library like jQuery.  
Use of framework like React, Vue or Lit-Element is optional but **highly** valued.  

***JS/TS is the minimum, if you can use React/Vue/Lit-Element framework for more "points".***  

Place your code into `src` folder. Structure is up to you.

## Design
Image assets are located in the folder as stated previously. 
For the rest (buttons, inputs) use whatever suits you (Bulma or Bootstrap preferred).

## Optional
- multiple dice (up to 5)
- calculate sum of dice (shows button only if more than 1 dice is selected)

## Result
Upload finished project to your public Github and send us the link for review ;)
